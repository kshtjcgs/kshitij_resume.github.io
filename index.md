Telecommunication engineer and data science passionate.

What I really love about data science is how research and coding together are much more fun! 

I discovered data science with a Machine Learning course in Coursera by professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University, and soon realized I wanted to go deeper. To do so, I joined Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Google at Udacity, where learned really useful things through hands on projects, working with data in python using scikit-learn, pandas, scipy and numpy.  I completed the course with a capstone project on deep learning using Tensorflow with the objective of detecting whales through recordings made at the sea.

Right now, I am following a new course at Udacity, the Data Analyst Nanodegree by Facebook and MongoDB, where I am learning in order how to properly analyze data, how to make good visualizations of data, R, SQL and mongoDB, OpenStreetMap, D3.js and A/B tests.
