Telecommunication engineer and data science passionate.


What I really love about data science is how research and coding together are much more fun! 

I discovered data science with a [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course in Coursera by professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University, and soon realized I wanted to go deeper. To do so, I joined [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) by Google at Udacity, where I learned really useful things through hands on projects, working with data in Python using scikit-learn, pandas, scipy and numpy.  I completed the course with a capstone project on deep learning using Tensorflow with the objective of detecting whales through recordings made at the sea.

Right now, I am following a new course at Udacity, the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) by Facebook and MongoDB, where I am learning how to properly analyze data and make good visualizations. I am acquiring new skills in test analysis, R (ggplot, dplyr...), SQL and mongoDB, OpenStreetMap, D3.js and A/B tests.


I also love to apply all these skills to help other students as Udacity Project Reviewer in projects related to Deep Learning, Statistical Analysis and general Machine Learning.
