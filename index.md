Telecommunication engineer and data science passionate.


What I really love about data science is how research and coding together are much more fun! 

I discovered data science with a [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course in Coursera by professor Andrew Ng from Stanford University, and soon realized I wanted to go deeper. To do so, I joined [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) by Google at Udacity, where I learned really useful things through hands on projects, working with data in Python using scikit-learn, pandas, scipy and numpy.  I completed the course with a capstone project on deep learning using Tensorflow with the objective of detecting whales through recordings made at the sea.

I also have completed he [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) by Facebook and MongoDB, where I learned how to properly analyze data and make good visualizations. I acquired new skills in test analysis, R (ggplot, dplyr...), D3.js, SQL, OpenStreetMap and A/B tests.


I also love to apply all these skills to help other students from the [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) and the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) as **Udacity Project Reviewer** in projects related to Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistical Analysis and general Machine Learning.


In addition, I spend my time as a **Udacity Classroom Mentor** guiding students from the Machine Learning Nanodegree and the Data Analyst Nanodegree.
