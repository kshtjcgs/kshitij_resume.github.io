My name is Mabel Villalba Jim√©nez. I'm a Data Scientist and Python Developer.

Currently, I work as a Python Developer at [Scrapinghub](https://scrapinghub.com/). I am also contractor in Machine Learning, Python and R projects, striving at giving clients the best and most accurate solution for their needs.

In addition, I spend my time working for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as:

- **Classroom Mentor**: guiding students from the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) and the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
- **Project Reviewer**: helping students from the [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) and the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) as in projects related to Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistical Analysis and general Machine Learning.


I love contributing to Open Source projects like the Python libraries [Scikit-Learn](ttps://github.com/mabelvj/scikit-learn), for Machine Learning and [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev), for data structure and data analysis. See the list of contributions in the [Open Source Contributions](pullrequests) section.

Also, I really enjoy trying to answer questions on Stackoverflow ([Stackoverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9051284/mabel-villalba)).
